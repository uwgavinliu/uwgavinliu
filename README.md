#### Hello Peeps 👋, Gavin Reporting In :)

##### I'm a Chemical Engineering Student @ the University of Waterloo, and an incoming Engineering Analyst @ Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. Although coding has never really been my strong suit, I've stuck with it for a long time and constantly trying to get better at it! I find great value in using technology to create innovations, so I won't give up on those syntax errors... just yet!
